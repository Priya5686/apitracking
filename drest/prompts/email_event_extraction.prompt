- **Deadline**: If the content includes an expiry date or time.  
- **Due**: If it includes a target completion date or time.  
- **Task**: If the content describes an action to be completed.  
- **Receipt**: If it involves purchases or transactions after a payment.  
- **Bill**: If the content includes invoices or payments to be made.  
- **Tracking**: If it provides a valid tracking number related to a shipment.  
- **Schedule**: If the information includes an event’s start date or end date.  
- **Renewal**: If the content relates to a recurring activity.  
- **Delivery**: If the information contains a delivery date for an order.  
- **Appointment**: If the content describes an event arranged in advance.  
- **Other**: If the data does not fit into any of the above categories.
